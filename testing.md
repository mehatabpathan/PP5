### Python Validation - Pycodestyle
Python testing was done using Pycodestyle to ensure there were no syntax errors.

The only errors displayed (as per below screenshot) can be ignored. The majority are within automatically generated files with the exception of env.py and webhooks.py. 

I have ignored the the formatting errors related to env.py as they relate to my Secret Keys and Database URL being to long. This file is not committed to github.

## Fixed Bugs

**Checkout form**

When testing the Checkout Form, I was able to input white space into the form text fields and enter text into the phone number field and still submit the form. This would then return a 500 error however the Stripe payment would still get processed. I had followed the steps in the Boutique Ado project for the checkout app and when I tested the Boutique Ado project and a number of other students' projects the same situation would arise when I submitted with form with just whitespace in the form fields. 

I wrote a custom `clean_fieldname` method for a number of the form fields in order to `trim` whitespace from the form fields during form validation. 

``` 
    def clean_full_name(self):
        if not self.cleaned_data['full_name'].strip():
            raise ValidationError("You must enter a fullname")
        return self.cleaned_data['full_name']
```

However this didn't solve the issue as I realised that the form validation wasn't actually getting called before the payment was processed. 

After a bit of digging, I discovered that the reason for this is due to the fact the Stripe Javascript is called when the submit button is clicked due to the event listener on the submit button. The Javascript prevents the default form submission meaning that the card is actually charged before any form validation is done. 

When the response comes back from Stripe, the `.then()` part of the JS runs, which checks to see if the card was charged successfully, and if so, the form is then submitted and validation is ran. If the form is valid, it saves the order to the database. If the validation fails webhook will create the order in the database anyway.

As a workaround in the short term I was able to add a widget to the form fields in the Checkout Form to specify the pattern attribute of the HTML input. This prevents the form from submitted if there is whitespace at the beginning of a text input or if there is letters in the phone field.

```
        self.fields['full_name'].widget.attrs[
            'pattern'] = "([^\\s][A-z0-9À-ž\x27\\s]+)"
        self.fields['street_address1'].widget.attrs[
            'pattern'] = "([^\\s][A-z0-9À-ž\x27\\s]+)"
        self.fields['town_or_city'].widget.attrs[
            'pattern'] = "([^\\s][A-z0-9À-ž\x27\\s]+)"
```

I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19619428/html5-form-validation-pattern-alphanumeric-with-spaces) stackoverflow post helpful when learning about the pattern attribute.

Ideally I would have preferred to find a way to perform full form validation before the payment is processed however due to time contraints I was unable to figure out a work around for the purpose of this project. A suggestion would be to create the order in the database `on submit` with a status of "Pending" and then process the Payment. Once the payment is processed successfully, update the order status to "complete" in the database. 

**Success Toast**

Every time a success message appeared (for adding a testimonial, submitting enquiry etc.) and if the user had items in their shopping bag, the success message would display the bag contents as well as the message in the toast. I only wanted the shopping bag contents to display if the user has successfully added a product to their bag and not for other success messages. 
After a bit of research I discovered I could add extra context into Django generic views using `get_context_data`, and therefore I was able to add context to only show the simplified message for certain views such as Add Testimonial, Enquiries and Add Project. 

**Deployment**

When I initially attempted to deploy to Heroku the build would fail with the error message "Could not build wheels for backports.zoneinfo". This was due to the fact that Heroku by default uses python version 3.10 which isn't compatible with backports.zoneinfo. In order to fix this I had to create a runtime.txt to specify the Python version for Heroku to install (python-3.8.13). However the next time I tried to deploy I got a further error "Requested runtime 'python-3.8.13' is not available for this stack (heroku-22)". After some research I realised that in order to use this version of Python I would have to use heroku-20 instead of heroku-22. I was able to downgrade the heroku version using the command `heroku stack:set heroku-20 -a app name` which resolved the issue and I was able to deploy the site.
